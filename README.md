# RoadCraft Vehicle Editor v2 Dyanmic game loading

Fork from https://github.com/samu126-HU/roadcraft-vehicle-editor

I added the ability to select the game folder, so all vehicles and their properties are now loaded directly from the game instead of a hardcoded database. This makes the editor compatible with other mods that modify vehicle properties.

Launch RoadCraft Vehicle Editorv2.exe

Select your RoadCraft game folder (e.g. C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\RoadCraft)

Choose the vehicle whose properties you want to modify

Save (saving to .pak is the safest and easiest option — choose ...\RoadCraft\root\paks\client\default\default_other.pak)
---

**Happy modding!**
